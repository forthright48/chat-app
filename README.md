# Chat App

A simple chat app built with socket.io. Visit [chat-app-fr48.herokuapp.com](http://chat-app-fr48.herokuapp.com/) to have a look.

Currently, it's exact copy of the example on socket.io's website. I plan to complete the homework given.

# To Do

These are the following improvements mentioned by socket.io:

1. ~Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects~
2. Add support for nicknames
3. ~~Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.~~
4. Add “{user} is typing” functionality
5. Show who’s online
6. Add private messaging
7. Share your improvements!

Some improvements of my own:

1. ~~New message gets hidden behind input form.~~
2. ~~Stop adding blank messages.~~
3. ~~Wrap long messages.~~
